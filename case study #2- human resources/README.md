 This case study is about the details of employees of a company. Here I used various SQL skills to analyze the data provided and also solved the business questions   asked. To sucessfully answer all the questions you should have been exposed to the following areas of SQL:

* Basic aggregations
* CASE WHEN statements
* Window Functions
* Joins
* Date time functions
* CTEs


Please join me in executing the queries using PostgreSQL on [DB fibble](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/xckGL9ZW73A6FWhsmPogm7/6). It would be great to work together on these questions given below 👇
