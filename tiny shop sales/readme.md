This Case Study is about a Tiny shop which deals wih some products. Here dataset which is provided consists of tables named as
1. Products - which gives the details like product_name, price,product_id of the products that are sold in this shop.
2. Customer - which gives details of customer_id, their names who all visited the shop and purchased products from there.
3. order - which gives details of order_id and order_date associated with each order and customers.
4. order items - which gives details of order_id, product_id as well as quantity purchased by customers of each product.

Using the tiny shop order data, I calculated metrics important to the organization, and analyzed data for order rate, spending and sales pattern and product popularity.

To sucessfully answer all the questions you should have been exposed to the following areas of SQL:

* Basic aggregations
* CASE WHEN statements
* Window Functions
* Joins
* Date time functions
* CTEs
Please join me in executing the queries using PostgreSQL on [DB fibble](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/5NT4w4rBa1cvFayg2CxUjr/4). It would be great to work together on these questions given below 👇
